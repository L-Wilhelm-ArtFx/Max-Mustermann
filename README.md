# CPP Max Mustermann
## Setup
- Clone with `git clone --recursive <git-url>` (git submodules are used to add dependencies)
- Compile using cmake / use the vscode cmake plugin
Alternatively a build can be found in the build.zip archive.

Program expects the existence of a ./levels folder inside the working directory.

## Controls
Arrow keys - Move Camera (or cursor when mouse cursor off)
Left click / Space - Place tile

## Code
Most code is hastily stuffed in main.cpp and barely commented. Sorry for that...üôè
